# Digital Clock

Welcome to the Digital Clock project! This simple website displays the current time in Indian Standard Time (IST). The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript's built-in functions, such as `Date`, `setInterval`, and working with the Document Object Model (DOM) to access and modify properties.

## Features

- **Real-time Clock**: The website dynamically updates and displays the current time in IST.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Leverages the power of JavaScript to handle time-related functions.
- **Responsive Design**: The clock is designed to be visually appealing and responsive on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styles the webpage for an enhanced user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the clock functionality and interacts with the DOM.
